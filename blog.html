            1. State differences between local storage and session storage?
        </h3>
        <p>Ans: The difference between localStorage and sessionStorage has to do with lifetime and scope: how long the
            data
            is saved for and who the data is accessible to. Session storage is destroyed once the user closes the
            browser
            whereas, Local storage stores data with no expiration date. The main difference is that while data in local
            Storage doesn't expire, data in session Storage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document
            is
            loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that
            particular
            tab.</p>

        <h3>2. State differences between global scope and block scope?</h3>
        <p>
            Ans: In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object while in Node. js, it's
            controlled by the global object. Block scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for statements,
            and
            the like. The Global scope is a variable that exists inside or outside a block. If a variable is declared
            outside all functions or curly braces ({}), it exists in the global scope. Block scopes are what you get
            when
            you use if statements, for statements, and the like. You can also use them stand-alone with a simple
            begin-end
            curly braces {}, not to be confused with empty object literals.

        <h3>3. How does event loop work in js?</h3>
        <p>
            Ans: The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack
            is
            empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which
            effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop. In a thread, the function at the
            top
            of the stack is what's currently running. The event loop is at the bottom of the stack, or at least it's
            underneath all JavaScript functions, so it only gets to run when all previously running JavaScript functions
            have returned or thrown.
